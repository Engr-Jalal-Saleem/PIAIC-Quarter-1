/* The code is calculating the value of the equation (((10+5)*3.2)/(4%3)-7) and storing it in the
variable eqn. The equation consists of several mathematical operations: addition, multiplication,
division, modulus, and subtraction. The result of the equation is then printed to the console using
console.log().
there is an error in the question
There should be a parenthesis after -7, which was missing in the question
